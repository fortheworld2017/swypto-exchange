        h1.page-title What are crypto currencies?
        p
          | Cryptocurrencies first entered the digital scene in 2009, with Bitcoin as the first of its kind. During 2011,
          | the second wave of new cryptocurrencies hit, with Namecoin and Litecoin.  Since then, over 530 cryptocurrencies
          | have emerged.  Some of these currencies are agnostic to the consumer base, while there are specific
          | cryptocurrencies that attract a specific demographic.

        p
          | Cryptocurrencies are currently understood and treated strictly as digital assets (virtual coin/currency) and
          | not as fiat currency. However, there are a growing amount of merchants willing to accept coins as payment, which
          | inevitably raises some interesting questions regarding the necessity and associated tastes involved in
          | analyzing these kinds of currencies over traditional fiat currencies.

        p
          | In Satoshi Nakamoto’s (founder of Bitcoin) paper, Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System, Satoshi
          | outlines his reasoning for creating Bitcoin, which can briefly be summarized as providing a service that
          | “…is an electronic payment system based on cryptographic proof instead of trust, allowing any two willing
          | parties to transact directly with each other without the need for a trusted third party”.

        p
          | However, what was left out of his paper was the additional philosophic undertones promoting a kind of libertarian,
          | democratic and anarchy-capitalistic philosophy. What is implied in the quote provided above is the end of the
          | need for a digital third-party bank or PayPal system that facilitates and validates transactions. Satoshi’s
          | notions of cryptocurrency directly promote the free flow of capital, as well as maintain the concept of
          | relative anonymity in transactions. In this way, the notion of cryptocurrency, dissolves the need for the
          | traditional trust based fiat currency, and instead supplements a form of currency that does not require
          | additional transaction costs that are often associated with reversible and negotiable transactions.
          | As of November 2014, the total market value of all cryptocurrencies is $6.4bn, according to coinmarketcap.com.
